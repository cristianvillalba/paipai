Hi, 

My name is Cristian Villalba, and I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
This is my final project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science.

I finally took the path to make a VideoGame with LOVE2D framework.
I wanted to push myself a little further and keep on learning, so I decided to make a tribute to 2.5D engines such as Wolfenstein/DukeNukem3D that I enjoyed in my youth.

So after reading and searching a lot I came up with an almost like Build Engine (DukeNukem3D) implementation in LUA.

Pai Pai speedrunner
-------------------

Its a simple first person view game. 
The purpose is to run through all the levels (11 in total) as fast as you can, avoiding some enemies and finding the way out.
To advance to the next level you will need to find the Flag.

Controls
--------

To move the player:
up or w - foward
down or s - backwards
left - turn left
right - turn right
a - strafe left
d - strafe right
space - action

At the beginning of each round you have the possibility to chose 3 types of action, selecting them with the 1, 2, or 3 key:
Action 1 is a shield that pushes enemies away from you
Action 2 allows you to jump
Action 3 allows you to shot shurikens.

Shield can be blocked with shurikens, shurikens can be jumped, and jump is weak against shield

Enemies can also attack you with the same types, all the enemies in the same level will have the same attack,
and the type of attack of the enemies will be random on each level.

Highlights
----------

Rasterizer entirely implemented in LUA:
Sector/Portals
View frustum
Sprites
Floor
Lots of vector math that almost drive me crazy

Procedural maze generation, keep in mind that the first 11 levels are fixed.
